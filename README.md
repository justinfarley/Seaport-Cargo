# Seaport-Cargo

## This program takes a string of uppercase alphabetical letters, and mimics the idea of a seaport cargo

### Ships come to the port and drop off shipping containers that are labeled by an uppercase letter. 

### A Container with a letter that is further in the alphabet cannot be placed on top of a container with a label earlier in the alphabet. E.G B cannot be placed on A, but A can be placed on top of B.

### See Tower of Hanoi.

### This program uses stacks to compute where the containers should go. If a container cannot be placed on any of the existing stacks, a new stack is created with that container in it.
